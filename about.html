    My name is Anas Morsi, and I’m a computer science student at Kettering
    University in my junior year. I was born in Flint, MI to Egyptian
    immigrant parents, and I was raised in Flint. As a child growing
    up I had interests in many things including sports, music, movies,
    but I had a special interest in technology specifically computers.
    My parents were never fond of how much time I spent using our desktop
    home computer, but in hindsight they’re happy they let me slide some
    nights to stay up exploring all the functions of our home computer.
    Being born to Egyptian parents I travel back to Egypt often to
    reconnect with family and friends and to keep up to date on my
    culture and heritage that has been so close to my heart. Ironically,
    going back to Egypt helped fuel my passion for web development and
    UX design as many of my family members work as engineers and computer
    engineers.

    I started off as student at the University of Michigan-Flint, but
    I knew that with Kettering just around the corner I would’ve been
    doing myself a disservice not transferring to their world class
    computer science program, and so I did just that. I have gained
    so much out of my experience in my first year, and I am eternally
    grateful for my co-op and the opportunities presented here at
    Kettering.

    After my experience with my start-up as a web developer and user
    experience designer I found I had a great interest in web development
    and UX design. I was able through Kettering to find a great co-op and
    really expand on my skill set. I’ve worked many jobs in my lifetime
    to pay bills and have money in my pocket, but I finally feel like
    I’ve started working for something more than money. It seemed only
    natural to choose a degree which interested me. After completing
    several web applications for clients, I realized that web development
    and UX design is the occupation I would like to follow on successful
    completion of my degree.

    My work experience taught me a lot about the computer industry
    especially the processes that are involved in designing and
    implementing a website. I also worked on the design and front
    end development for a very big and well established company
    and my final product went up live. Being able to work on big
    name projects while also being a student is a very valuable tool
    that my university offers, and it has helped me immensely as I
    progress into a full-time web developer and designer.

    Outside of school I enjoy sports, especially soccer and basketball.
    I also enjoy reading computing publications as I like to keep up to
    date with new technology. I also enjoy listening to music especially
    Arabic music, rap, and hip-hop. I also enjoy traveling the world and
    seeing the mix of cultures; I enjoy experiencing different ways of
    life and trying not to be a tourist, but trying to speak the local
    languages and observe their traditions. I think this gives me a
    better perspective on the countries I visit, and it also opens
    my mind to different environments and paces of life. My experiences
    traveling have also shown me different perspectives on where certain
    parts of the world are from a technological standpoint, which is
    valuable to my overall understating as to why I am pursuing the
    career that I am pursuing.
